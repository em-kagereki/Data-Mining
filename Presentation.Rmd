# Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) 

- Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of global mortality.
- Prediction of prognosis model for patients with suspected ACS is important in critical care medicine.
- Syndromes Suggestive of Ischemia or Infarction is a term given to diverse presentations related to cardiomyopathies of sudden onset.

- Terms commonly used in the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome and the related differential diagnosis include:

*"stemi","acute coronary syndrome","angina","tachycardia","aortic aneurysm","pericardi","ortic dissection","coronary artery dissection","cardiomyopathy","heart failure","mitral valve disease","mitral stenosis","coronary artery disease","chf","congestive heart failure","heart failure","telemetry","myocardial infaction","cardiac arrest","myocardial infarction","aortic stenosis","st elevated","pericardial effusion", "cardiomyopathy","cath lab","tamponade","tamponede"*

# Proactively making clinical decisions.

# MIMIC-III database

- Freely-available database comprising deidentified health related data from 46,520 patients who stayed in critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012.

- Pre-requisite for data access:
1. Become a credentialed user on PhysioNet after completion of a training course in human
subjects research.
2. Sign the data data usage agreement.

- All data was collected downloaded  to  PostgreSQL database. 

- Loinc data tables were used to enrich the data. [Loinc tables](https://loinc.org/downloads/)]

---

## Objectives

The aim of the project was:

 - Build a binary classifier to predict all-cause mortality of patients based on demographics and interventions within first hour of suspected ACS event.
 
- Identify and describe variations in care pathway between patients who died and those who
survived.

This was achieved by:

- Developing a risk-prediction **machine learning classifier**, focusing on clinical end point of all-cause
mortality after one hour of treatment(golden hour).
- Explanation of the predicted outcome based on the care pathway using process mining. This AHA guideline(ACLS 2020) will was used as the gold standard for ACS workflow`*`.

# Data cleaning

Missing values
.pull-left[
1. Patient ID was used where admission ID was missing.

2. Missing *ETHNICITY* and *MARITAL_STATUS*  was replaced with *UNKNOWN* 

]
Data formatting
.pull-right[
- Deletion of irrelevant word - Example *rule/out*, *status post*

 - Modifying  incorrect, incomplete, irrelevant, duplicated, or improperly formatted data.

Example of diagnosis:
$$3VD
\begin{cases} 
\text{3 vessel cad} \\
\text{3 vessel coronary artery disease}\\
\text{three vessel coronary artery disease}\\
\text{3 vessel diagnosis}\\
\text{3 vessel disease}

# Data enrichment 
Done by appending the collected data with relevant context obtained from additional sources.

- Data on drugs enriched with drug formularly: BNF

- Laboratory drugs enhanced with the Loinc table

# Data transformation

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#Wide, or unstacked data is presented with each different data variable in a separate column. Narrow, or stacked data is presented #with one column containing all the values and another column listing the context of the value

```


Data was transformed from the narrow format to the wide format.


Step 1: Aggregation by Admission ID




Step 2: Split into multiple columns

- The aim of the model was to maximize the identification of the patients at the highest risk of death (tp). 
- F-beta measure  was used ( set at 2 to give less weight to precision and more weight to recall)
$$Recall =  \frac{TP}{TP+FN}$$
$$Precision =  \frac{TP}{TP+FP}$$
$$F-score =  2*\frac{Recall*Precision}{Precision+Recall}$$

# Candidate models

To initiate the process the following candidate models were chosen

- Regression based: Logistic regression, Linear discriminant,SVM 
- Decision trees: Random forests, Gradient boosting.
- Kernel based: k-Nearest neighbor.
- Information based: Naive Bayes.
- Quadratic discriminant analysis.

Now we can use our validation set (k folds) to estimate the performance of our models using the fit_resamples() function to fit the models on each of the folds and store the results.

- The metrics used were

# Model tuning 

- Grid search algorithm was used to train multiple  models simultaneously.
- Space-filling design to tune,  25 candidate models simultaneoulsy.

# Limitations

- The data pre-processing may be a hindrance in model deployment - data encoding, PCA.

- Random shifting of event dates may have an impact on the temporal sequence of the events.

- Limited computation capacity thus more experiments were not run - dimension reduction(UMAP, t-SNE), Neural networks. 

 
---
# Conclusion

- Successful extraction, loading and transformation of data from the MIMIC-III database.

- Run data cleaning (text editing) data pre-processing (encoding (hash and frequency encoding), principal component analysis).

- Built a machine learning classifier to predict all-cause mortality of the patients suspected to have acute cardiac syndrome.

- Identified potential root causes of the patient outcome.
